    I started with an interesting built in p5 function called pointilize which takes an image and populates a blank page with
    various ellipses to fill in its original parts.based on pixel information. This was a cool start so I added some variation
    in size, speed, and color. I also set the background to randomly draw from the images pixels and choose that pixel’s color.
    Some minor changes to fill effects and ellipse borders and I got what seemed to be a pretty interesting thing going. So I 
    flipped on some music to get the creative juices flowing and bumped into an old synth-wave song I enjoy: Memory by Com Truise.
    I knew I had to use the song but I wasn’t exactly sure how. I came to the conclusion that I would pointilize my favorite album
    cover of his (In Decay) for aesthetic purposes; however, the song I chose was from a different album but fit perfectly. 
    This all seemed cool enough but It was missing something.
    
    Eventually after starting my page up enough times, I realized the beginning of the song sort of reminded me of droplets or 
    impacts so I looked around for some p5 rain drop tutorials and came across who seems to be the king of p5, Daniel shiffman. 
    I adjusted his raindrop trails to flash various colors upon holding the mouse down and caused them to spread puddles upon 
    impact at random locations. As the user holds down the mouse, the puddles get larger and flash various colors and I also 
    randomized some stroke outlines for added effect. I also made it so that if the user presses the spacebar the background 
    color gets reassigned based on random pixel data. Using this random pixel data helps keep the aesthetic within the same color 
    palette and really adds to the theme of “memory” because it all seems so familiar even if you open it up 10 times. It’s not 
    exactly a drawing tool but it still has interactivity. In just pressing and holding the mouse at different times along with 
    rhythmically spacebar, I was able to sort of produce a specific performative outcome. The pseudo DJ feeling you get from 
    toying around with this little thing is fun but whatever you do end up creating is unfortunately temporary and not directly 
    reproducible. In a sense, this was a happy little accident because thematically, I was going for something that felt random 
    but at the same time just familiar enough to give you a bit of nostalgia. There’s something eerie about the song no matter
    how many times I listen to it, it just feels different yet somehow extremely familiar. It has a certain procedural sound to 
    it that keeps it feeling fresh. I wish I could explain my aesthetic and thematic goals more effectively but in a lot of ways 
    it speaks for itself.
    
As far as what went wrong or right I think my only complaint is that I didn’t stumble upon a rigid goal or vision so I felt 
like what I created just ended up being decent rather than really personally relevant or inspired. In saying that, I think there is
a certain beauty to randomizing even the simplest stuff like this because I still was able to just make some arbitrary decisions 
and end up with something that still gives off a pretty interesting vibe even if it wasn’t extremely well thought out or planned. 
I thought about automating some of the drawing processes a bit more and adding the ability for the user to modify more of the 
sound rather than just the image but I instead settled on just giving them the ability to stop the music if it got distracting. 
If I had to do this all again I’d set aside a lot more time and maybe come up with a battle plan ahead of time but I guess 
exploring is cool too.
